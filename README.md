This poker website allows users to enter a room of their choice after signing in. They can choose between different tables based on their required buy-ins and blinds. Once at the table, the user can play until they would like to sit out. At this point, they can increase their balance, leave the table, or sit back in.

Rush Poker was designed as a Cash-game poker website, and the rules are implemented as such.

As an admin, one can edit tables that are in play, dynamically create and delete tables, and add users through the admin panel.
